## Day 3: January 11, Friday.

**Today's Progress**:

🍝CSS Diner: A game for learning CSS selectors. Done✅

Selectors are how you pick which element to apply styles to.

```CSS
h1 {
    text-align: center;
}
```
Here h1 is the selector. Sellect all `<h1>` elements and applies text-align style.

## Day 4: January 12, Saturday.

**Today's Progress**:

How CSS style overriding works by relevance:

* Id style
* Class style (Last class declaration more relevant)
* Element style

When *!important* rule is used, it overrides any other style declarations.

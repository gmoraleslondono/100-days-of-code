# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: January 8, Tuesday.

After a long time thinking 🙄 about starting, today I said "Challenge accepted"🥳

**🏆 My goal:** Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**🛤️ Links to the roadmap:** 
* [learn.freecodecamp.org](https://learn.freecodecamp.org)
* [www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com)
* [exercism.io](https://exercism.io)

## Day 1: January 9, Wednesday.

**Today's Progress**:

🛫 Starting! Taking a quick HTML review🛵.
I remembered the markup language structure, syntax and some elements that usually are used🤓.

## Day 2: January 10, Thursday.

**Today's Progress**:

Today I went into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). 👩‍Exploring the relationship between content, padding, margin, and border📏 also known as the box model📦

## Day 3: January 11, Friday.

**Today's Progress**:

🍝CSS Diner: A game for learning CSS selectors. Done✅

Selectors are how you pick which element to apply styles to.

```CSS
h1 {
    text-align: center;
}
```
Here h1 is the selector. Sellect all `<h1>` elements and applies text-align style.

## Day 4: January 12, Saturday.

**Today's Progress**:

How CSS style overriding works by relevance:

* Id style
* Class style (Last class declaration more relevant)
* Element style

When *!important* rule is used, it overrides any other style declarations.

**Today's Progress**:

Keep going with CSS🤠

👩‍🎨Style a specific color using:
Color name, Hex code, abbreviated Hex Code or RGB values.

```CSS
/*Color name*/
.text-green {
  color: green;

/*Hex code*/
.text-pink {
  color: #FFC0CB;
}
/*Hex code abbreviated*/
.text-white {

}
/*RGB value*/
.text-red {
  color: rgb(255,0,0);

## Day 25: February 13, Wednesday.

Starting with fundamental #javascript 🥳

🙏 I hope I will get soon my Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures 🙄 #freecodecamp certification 👩‍🎓

## Day 26: February 14, Thursday.

Learning JavaScript Basic Methods

**.push()** ---> Adds one or more parameters at the end of the array.

```JavaScript
var arr = [1,2,3];
arr.push(4);
//arr is now [1,2,3,4]
```
**.pop()** ---> Removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

```JavaScript
var arr = [1,2,3];
var val = arr.pop();
//arr is now [1,2]
//val is now [3]
```
**.shift()** ---> Removes the first element from an array.

```JavaScript
var arr = [1,2,3];
var val = arr.shift();
//arr is now [2,3]
//val is now [1]
```
**.unshift()** ---> Adds the element at the beginning of the array.

```JavaScript
var arr = [1,2,3];
arr.unshift(0);
//arr is now [0,1,2,3]
```

## Day 27: February 15, Friday.

Taking time to learn about version control and GitHub. Today I used GitHub Learning Lab to practice:

😻 Introduction to GitHub.

🤳 Communicating using Markdown.

## Day 28: February 16, Saturday.

Scope refers to the visibility of variables.

In JavaScript there are two types of scope:

   * Local scope
   * Global scope
   
Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.

See an example:
    
```JavaScript
    var someColor = "red"; // Variable with global scope
    
    function myFun() {
        var someSentence = someColor + " hat"; // Variable with local scope
        return someSentence;
    }
    
    console.log("I have a " + myFun()); // I have a red hat
```

* [Freecodecamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/global-vs--local-scope-in-functions/
)

## Day 29: February 19, Tuesday.

🥳 Learning #JavaScript 🧙‍♀️ how to use functions. I did a comparative exercise for lookups: Using Objects Vs Switch statement Vs Else if statement ⬇️


**Switch statement:**

```JavaScript

function myFunction(val) {
    var result = "";

    switch(val) {
      case "a": 
        result = "Adams";
        break;
      case "b": 
        result = "Boston";
        break;
      case "c": 
        result = "Chicago";
        break;
      case "d": 
        result = "Denver";
        break;
      case "e": 
        result = "Easy";
        break;
      case "f": 
        result = "Frank";
    }
  
    return result;
  }
  
  myFunction("c"); // "Chicago"
  ```
  
  **Else if statement:**
  
  ```JavaScript
  
function myFunction(val) {
    var result = "";

    if (val === "a") {
        result = "Adams";
    } else if ( val === "b") {
        result = "Boston";
    } else if ( val === "c") {
        result = "Chicago";
    } else if ( val === "d") {
        result = "Denver";
    } else if ( val === "e") {
        result = "Easy";
    } else if ( val === "f") {
        result = "Frank";
    }
  
    return result;
  }
  
  myFunction("c"); // "Chicago"
  ```
  
   **Object:**
  
  ```JavaScript
  
function myFunction(val) {
  var result = "";

  var lookup = {
    "a" : "Adams",
    "b" : "Boston",
    "c" : "Chicago",
    "d" : "Denver",
    "e" : "Easy",
    "f" : "Frank"
  };

  result = lookup[val];

  return result;
}

myFunction("c"); // "Chicago"
```

## Day 30: February 20, Wednesday.

30 days ago I started this journey 😱 the time is going so fast! 🚀

Today I took a little break from JavaScript and got relax playing with #CSS 🥰

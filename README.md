# 100 Days Of Code

This challenge encourages you to practice whatever you want to learn for 100 days a minimum of 1 hour per day. It is important to write a log with the learned every day.

## Daily log

## Day 0: January 8, Tuesday.

After a long time thinking 🙄 about starting, today I said "Challenge accepted"🥳

**🏆 My goal:** Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**🛤️ Links to the roadmap:** 
* [learn.freecodecamp.org](https://learn.freecodecamp.org)
* [www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com)
* [exercism.io](https://exercism.io)

## Day 1: January 9, Wednesday.

**Today's Progress**:

🛫 Starting! Taking a quick HTML review🛵.
I remembered the markup language structure, syntax and some elements that usually are used🤓.

## Day 3: January 11, Friday.

**Today's Progress**:

🍝CSS Diner: A game for learning CSS selectors. Done✅

Selectors are how you pick which element to apply styles to.

```CSS
h1 {
    text-align: center;
}
```
Here h1 is the selector. Sellect all `<h1>` elements and applies text-align style.

## Day 4: January 12, Saturday.

**Today's Progress**:

How CSS style overriding works by relevance:

* Id style
* Class style (Last class declaration more relevant)
* Element style

When *!important* rule is used, it overrides any other style declarations.

Starting with fundamental #javascript 🥳

🙏 I hope I will get soon my Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures 🙄 #freecodecamp certification 👩‍🎓

## Day 26: February 14, Thursday.

Learning JavaScript Basic Methods

**.push()** ---> Adds one or more parameters at the end of the array.

```JavaScript
var arr = [1,2,3];
arr.push(4);
//arr is now [1,2,3,4]
```
**.pop()** ---> Removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

```JavaScript
var arr = [1,2,3];
var val = arr.pop();
//arr is now [1,2]
//val is now [3]
```
**.shift()** ---> Removes the first element from an array.

```JavaScript
var arr = [1,2,3];
var val = arr.shift();
//arr is now [2,3]
//val is now [1]
```
**.unshift()** ---> Adds the element at the beginning of the array.

```JavaScript
var arr = [1,2,3];
arr.unshift(0);
//arr is now [0,1,2,3]
```

## Day 27: February 15, Friday.

Taking time to learn about version control and GitHub. Today I used GitHub Learning Lab to practice:

## Day 28: February 16, Saturday.

Scope refers to the visibility of variables.

In JavaScript there are two types of scope:

   * Local scope
   * Global scope
   
Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.

See an example:
    
```JavaScript
    var someColor = "red"; // Variable with global scope
    
    function myFun() {
        var someSentence = someColor + " hat"; // Variable with local scope
        return someSentence;
    }
    
    console.log("I have a " + myFun()); // I have a red hat
```

)

## Day 29: February 19, Tuesday.

🥳 Learning #JavaScript 🧙‍♀️ how to use functions. I did a comparative exercise for lookups: Using Objects Vs Switch statement Vs Else if statement ⬇️


**Switch statement:**

```JavaScript

function myFunction(val) {
    var result = "";

    switch(val) {
      case "a": 
        result = "Adams";
        break;
      case "b": 
        result = "Boston";
        break;
      case "c": 
        result = "Chicago";
        break;
      case "d": 
        result = "Denver";
        break;
      case "e": 
        result = "Easy";
        break;
      case "f": 
        result = "Frank";
    }
  
    return result;
  }
  
  myFunction("c"); // "Chicago"
  ```
  
  **Else if statement:**
  
  ```JavaScript
  
function myFunction(val) {
    var result = "";

    if (val === "a") {
        result = "Adams";
    } else if ( val === "b") {
        result = "Boston";
    } else if ( val === "c") {
        result = "Chicago";
    } else if ( val === "d") {
        result = "Denver";
    } else if ( val === "e") {
        result = "Easy";
    } else if ( val === "f") {
        result = "Frank";
    }
  
    return result;
  }
  
  myFunction("c"); // "Chicago"
  ```
  
   **Object:**
  
  ```JavaScript
  
function myFunction(val) {
  var result = "";

  var lookup = {
    "a" : "Adams",
    "b" : "Boston",
    "c" : "Chicago",
    "d" : "Denver",
    "e" : "Easy",
    "f" : "Frank"
  };

  result = lookup[val];

  return result;
}

myFunction("c"); // "Chicago"
```

## Day 33: February 24, Sunday.

🙆‍♀️ Today, I was solving some #JavaScript #freeCodeCamp challenges and practiced how to access nested objects and nested arrays.🤪

**The Challenge:**

Basic JavaScript: Record Collection

You are given a JSON object representing a part of your musical album collection. Each album has several properties and a unique id number as its key. Not all albums have complete information.

Write a function which takes an album's id (like 2548), a property prop (like "artist" or "tracks"), and a value (like "Addicted to Love") to modify the data in this collection.

If prop isn't "tracks" and value isn't empty (""), update or set the value for that record album's property.

Your function must always return the entire collection object.

There are several rules for handling incomplete data:

If prop is "tracks" but the album doesn't have a "tracks" property, create an empty array before adding the new value to the album's corresponding property.

If prop is "tracks" and value isn't empty (""), push the value onto the end of the album's existing tracks array.

If value is empty (""), delete the given prop property from the album.

Hints
Use bracket notation when accessing object properties with variables.

Push is an array method you can read about on Mozilla Developer Network.

You may refer back to Manipulating Complex Objects Introducing JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) for a refresher.

**The solution:**
```JavaScript

var collection = {
    "2548": {
      "album": "Slippery When Wet",
      "artist": "Bon Jovi",
      "tracks": [ 
        "Let It Rock", 
        "You Give Love a Bad Name" 
      ]
    },
    "2468": {
      "album": "1999",
      "artist": "Prince",
      "tracks": [ 
        "1999", 
        "Little Red Corvette" 
      ]
    },
    "1245": {
      "artist": "Robert Palmer",
      "tracks": [ ]
    },
    "5439": {
      "album": "ABBA Gold"
    }
};

function updateRecords(id, prop, value) {

  if (prop !== "tracks" && value !== "") {
    collection[id][prop] = value;
  }

  if (prop === "tracks" && !collection[id].hasOwnProperty("tracks")) {
    collection[id][prop] = [];
    collection[id][prop].push(value);
  }

  if (prop === "tracks" && value !== "") {
    collection[id][prop].push(value);
  }

  if (value === "") {
    delete collection[id][prop];
  }
  
  return collection;
}

// Alter values below to test your code
updateRecords(5439, "artist", "ABBA");
```

## Day 34: February 25, Monday.

Building shapes using pure #CSS. 🔴🔶🔼💚🛑

**Link(s) to work**:
* [Codepen practice](https://codepen.io/gmoraleslondono/pen/exwrQe?editors=1100)

## Day 35: February 26, Tuesday.

Some #ES6 topics that I learned today:

✅ Differences between var, const and let.

✅ Use Arrow Functions to write anonymous functions.

```JavaScript
const myFunc = () => "value"
```

✅ Use methods map() and filter().

```JavaScript
/*
Use arrow function syntax to compute the square of only the positive integers (decimal numbers are not integers) 
in the array realNumberArray and store the new array in the variable squaredIntegers.
*/

const realNumberArray = [4, 5.6, -9.8, 3.14, 42, 6, 8.34, -2];

const squareList = (arr) => {

  const squaredIntegers = 
    // use .filter() to sellect numbers that meet the conditions: 1. positive number (number>0) and 2. number without decimals (number%1 == 0)
        arr.filter((number) => number > 0 && number% 1 === 0)
    // use .map() to apply a math operation to each number, in this case get the squared (Math.pow(number, 2)) to each integer
        .map((number) => Math.pow(number, 2));

  return squaredIntegers;
};

// test your code
const squaredIntegers = squareList(realNumberArray);
console.log(squaredIntegers);

// const squaredIntegers = [16, 1764, 36]
```

## Day 36: February 27, Wednesday.

🔥 Finished ES6 chapter on #freeCodeCamp

🐻 I did a mini console App: "Bear, Human, Gun Game" #udemy

**Bear, Human, or Gun**

Bear human gun is just like Rock paper scissors. Each player chooses either bear, human, or gun. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

The possible outcomes are:

- Bear mauls human.

- Human disarms gun.

- Gun shoots bear.

- If there's a tie, then the game ends in a draw.

**Challenge:**

Our code will break the game into four parts:

1. Get the user's choice.

2. Get the computer's choice.

3. Compare the two choices and determine a winner.

4. Start the program and display the results.

**Solution:**

```JavaScript

function getUserChoice(userInput) {
  userInput = userInput.toLowerCase();
  if (userInput === "bear" || userInput === "human" || userInput === "gun") {
    return userInput;
  } else {
    return "Please sellect bear, human or gun";
  }
}
function getComputerChoice() {
  var choose = ["bear", "human", "gun"];
  var randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * choose.length);
  var randomChoose = choose[randomNumber];
  return randomChoose;
}
function determineWinner(userChoice, computerChoice) {
  if (userChoice === computerChoice) {
    return "Game tie!";
  }
  if (userChoice === "human") {
    if (computerChoice === "bear") {
      return "computer won!";
    } else {
      return "user won!";
    }
  }
  if (userChoice === "bear") {
    if (computerChoice === "gun") {
      return "computer won!";
    } else {
      return "user won!";
    }
  }
  if (userChoice === "gun") {
    if (computerChoice === "human") {
      return "computer won!";
    } else {
      return "user won!";
    }
  }
}
function playGame() {
  var promptUserChoice = prompt("Please choose bear, human or gun");
  promptUserChoice = promptUserChoice.toLowerCase();
  if (promptUserChoice === "") {
    return "Please choose bear, human or gun";
  }
  var userChoice = getUserChoice(promptUserChoice);
  var computerChoice = getComputerChoice();
  console.log(userChoice);
  console.log(computerChoice);
  console.log(determineWinner(userChoice, computerChoice));
}
playGame();

✔️ Mini App to convert temperature using basic JavaScript 🌡️

✔️ Mini App to measure calories using basic JavaScript 🧁🍊 

✔️ Used Chrome DevTools to debug my code 🐛😊


**Mini App: Convert temperature**

**Challenge:**

Use class keyword to create a Thermostat class. The constructor accepts Fahrenheit temperature.

Now create getter and setter in the class, to obtain the temperature in Celsius scale.

Remember that C = 5/9 * (F - 32) and F = C * 9.0 / 5 + 32, where F is the value of temperature 
in Fahrenheit scale, and C is the value of the same temperature in Celsius scale.

**Solution:**

```JavaScript
function makeClass() {
    "use strict";
    /* Alter code below this line */
    class Thermostat {
      constructor (temperatureFahrenheit) {
        this.temperatureFahrenheit = temperatureFahrenheit;
      }
      get temperature() {
        return 5/9 * (this.temperatureFahrenheit - 32);
      }
      set temperature(updateTemperature) {
        this.temperatureFahrenheit = updateTemperature * 9.0 / 5 + 32;
      }
    }
    /* Alter code above this line */
    return Thermostat;
  }
  const Thermostat = makeClass();
  const thermos = new Thermostat(76); // setting in Fahrenheit scale
  let temp = thermos.temperature; // 24.44 in C
  thermos.temperature = 26;
  temp = thermos.temperature; // 26 in C
```


**Mini App: Calorie Calculator**

**Challenge:**

The program will determine the actual and ideal calories you consumed last week. It will return a message based on if you ate too much or too little.

**Solution:**

```JavaScript
function inputCaloriesByDay(day) {

    switch (day) {
        case "Monday":
            return 3500;
            break;
        case "Tuesday":
            return 1500;
            break;
        case "Wednesday":
            return 2500;
            break;
        case "Thursday":
            return 2000;
            break;
        case "Friday":
            return 3000;
            break;
        case "Saturday":
            return 2800;
            break;
        case "Sunday":
            return 3000;
            break;
        default: 
            return "Please choose a valid day";
    }
}

function getTotalCalories() {
    var sum = inputCaloriesByDay("Monday")+
    inputCaloriesByDay("Tuesday")+
    inputCaloriesByDay("Wednesday")+
    inputCaloriesByDay("Thursday")+
    inputCaloriesByDay("Friday")+
    inputCaloriesByDay("Saturday")+
    inputCaloriesByDay("Sunday");

    return sum;
}

function getIdealCalories() {
    var idealDailyCalories = 2000;
    return idealDailyCalories*7;
}

function calculateHealthPlan() {
    var actualCalories = getTotalCalories();
    var idealCalories = getIdealCalories();
    if (actualCalories === idealCalories) {
        return "You ate just the right amount of food!";
    } else if (actualCalories > idealCalories) {
        return "Time to head to the gym!";
    } else if (actualCalories < idealCalories) {
        return "Time for seconds!";
    }
}

console.log(calculateHealthPlan()); //Time to head to the gym!
```
